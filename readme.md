Title: ALMSBTPS (A Learning Management System Better Than PowerSchool)

Description: The Service will allow you to sign in (via Google), and then display you the classes that you are in, and allow you to access relevant course material and information.

Architecture: Will need both a client and server. This project intends to build only the user-facing side of the infrastructure (i.e. only the iOS app for students, not the teacher interface or the server side)

Team: Jacob Wu

Challenges: Working with other people, different levels of competency
